   - **Components**:
     - **Authentication**: Supports different authentication mechanisms (password, OTP, multi-factor authentication, social logins).
     - **Authorization**: Manages user roles and permissions.
     - **User Federation**: Integrates with external identity providers or LDAP directories.
   
### 2. **User Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Manages user data across the system. It handles user creation, updates, deletion, and stores user profiles. This service is also responsible for managing user roles, groups, and attributes.
   - **Components**:
     - **User Registration**: Allows self-service registration for customers and vendors.
     - **User Profile Management**: Provides interfaces to manage user profiles.
     - **Role Management**: Manages roles and role-based access control (RBAC).

### 3. **Access Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: This service handles fine-grained access control and policy enforcement. It ensures that users have the correct permissions to access resources based on their roles, attributes, and the context of the request.
   - **Components**:
     - **Policy Administration**: Manages access policies.
     - **Policy Enforcement**: Enforces access control policies in real-time.

### 4. **Session Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Manages user sessions across the system. It handles session creation, validation, expiration, and logout. This service is critical for implementing features like Single Logout (SLO) and session revocation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Session Storage**: Stores active sessions.
     - **Session Revocation**: Allows administrators to revoke sessions.
     - **Single Logout**: Manages logout across multiple applications.

### 5. **Audit and Logging Service**
   - **Functionality**: Tracks and logs all authentication and authorization events. This service is crucial for compliance and security monitoring.
   - **Components**:
     - **Event Logging**: Logs authentication attempts, policy violations, etc.
     - **Audit Reports**: Generates reports for compliance and auditing purposes.

### 6. **Admin Console Service**
   - **Functionality**: Provides an interface for system administrators to manage the identity management system. It includes features for user management, role assignment, policy configuration, and system monitoring.
   - **Components**:
     - **User Management Interface**: Admin UI for managing users.
     - **Role and Policy Management**: UI for configuring roles and access policies.
     - **System Monitoring**: Dashboards for monitoring system health and usage.

### 7. **Client Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Manages clients (applications) that connect to the identity management system. It handles client registration, credentials, and settings.
   - **Components**:
     - **Client Registration**: Allows new applications to register with the IdP.
     - **Client Credentials Management**: Manages client secrets, certificates, etc.
     - **Redirect URIs and Settings**: Configures client-specific settings like redirect URIs.

### 8. **Integration Gateway Service**
   - **Functionality**: Acts as a gateway for integrating external systems and third-party applications. This service can handle API management, rate limiting, and transformations.
   - **Components**:
     - **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests.
     - **Transformation**: Converts data formats and protocols.

### 9. **Credential Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Manages user credentials securely. This service supports password management, recovery mechanisms, and credential rotation.
   - **Components**:
     - **Password Management**: Allows users to change or reset passwords.
     - **Credential Storage**: Securely stores user credentials.
     - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Manages second-factor credentials like OTP or hardware tokens.

### 10. **Notification Service**
   - **Functionality**: Handles sending notifications to users, such as verification emails, password reset instructions, and multi-factor authentication prompts.
   - **Components**:
     - **Email Service**: Sends emails for verification, password reset, etc.
     - **SMS Service**: Sends SMS notifications for MFA.
     - **Push Notifications**: Sends push notifications to mobile devices.

### 11. **Reporting and Analytics Service**
   - **Functionality**: Provides insights into user activity, authentication trends, and system usage. This service can generate reports and provide dashboards for administrators.
   - **Components**:
     - **User Activity Reports**: Generates reports on user login patterns.
     - **System Health Dashboard**: Monitors overall system performance.
     - **Custom Reports**: Allows administrators to create custom reports.

### 12. **Compliance and Risk Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Ensures that the identity management system complies with legal and regulatory requirements. This service also assesses risks associated with user access and authentication.
   - **Components**:
     - **Compliance Monitoring**: Tracks compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
     - **Risk Scoring**: Assesses the risk level of user activities.
     - **Data Retention Policies**: Manages the retention and deletion of user data.

### 13. **API Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Provides a central platform for managing and exposing APIs securely. It handles API versioning, access control, and monitoring.
   - **Components**:
     - **API Gateway**: Manages API traffic and security.
     - **API Documentation**: Provides API documentation for developers.
     - **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Controls the usage of APIs.

### 14. **Multi-Tenancy Management Service**
   - **Functionality**: Supports multi-tenant environments, allowing multiple organizations to use the identity management system with isolation between their data and configurations.
   - **Components**:
     - **Tenant Isolation**: Ensures data isolation between tenants.
     - **Tenant Configuration**: Allows each tenant to have custom configurations.

### 15. **Self-Service Portal**
   - **Functionality**: Provides a user-facing interface for employees, vendors, and customers to manage their own accounts, including password resets, profile updates, and multi-factor authentication setup.
   - **Components**:
     - **Account Management**: Allows users to manage their own accounts.
     - **Profile Update**: Enables users to update personal information.
     - **Security Settings**: Allows users to configure MFA and security questions.

This architecture offers flexibility, scalability, and security by decoupling functionalities into separate microservices. Each microservice can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled, allowing for more efficient management and continuous integration.
